- [] Bridge class, start method: figure out who won the hand 
- [] Bridge class, start method: take the start to the left of the player who won the bid (requires bidding to be in place)
- [] Bridge class, start method: account for trumps
- [] Bridge class, start method: update the player to start the round 
- [] Bridge class, bid method: implement bidding in some fashion?
