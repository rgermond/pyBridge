# pyBridge

A simple bridge game written in python, not yet in a working state

Work to be done still (in no particular order):

* Bridge class, bid method: implement bidding in some fashion? 
* Bridge class, play method: take the start to the left of the player who won the bid (requires bidding to be in place)
